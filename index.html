	<h2>Prologue</h2>
	<div class="chapter">
	<p >
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a time, in a kingdom called Lumina. There were 4 Holy Knights that lead and protect the Kingdom from the demons. Other than the 4 Holy Knights and their subordinate, no one knows how terrifying the outside world is. The 4 Knights agreed that each of them should protect one side of the Kingdom. Those Knights are; Robin the Raven protecting the North side of the Kingdom, Colart the Eagle protecting the South side of the Kingdom, Aveline the Flamingo protecting the West side of the Kingdom, and Randal the Hawk protecting the East side of the Kingdom.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, Randal and his subordinate feels a deadly presence coming from the East. “What’s with this deadly aura!?! I can’t even imagine a living thing that has this kind of aura” said one of Randal’s subordinate. “Sir, don’t you think we need to call the other Holy Knights?” said another one of his subordinate. “There’s no need to do that. The other Holy Knight member probably realize this deadly aura. No one could miss the presence of the Demon Lord” “DEMON LORD?!!?” shout his subordinates. “Go prepare yourselfs, this is going to be a hard battle.”
	</p><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4 Holy knights then gather on the eastest gate to prepare and discuss about how to defeat the Demon Lord. After a quick discussion, Aveline the Mage then remember about a sentence in the prophecy “In the prophecy it says that ‘The Demon Lord will be defeated by a young man.’, but right now we don't have any young man with us. What are we going to do now?” “Just stick with the plan, we don't have much time to think about that.” said Colart.
	</p><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fighting the Demon Lord for a whole day, it makes sense if they’re exhausted, but the thing is they got beaten by the Demon Lord, while the Demon Lord only get some scratches. Now they regret not believing the prophecy. Even tho they’re beaten they’re still doing their best to protect the Kingdom. After fighting for a while, finally one of them got a plan. “Everyone! I got a plan! I’m going to use a black magic to seal the Demon King. But to do that i need your help. Lend me your MP!!” shout Avelin. “We have no choice! Everyone! Lend her your power!!” shout Randal.
	</p><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thanks everyone! :’) *insert magical word here*” Suddenly a small shining ball come out from her hand and hit the Demon Lord. The shiny ball then became so bright that no one could see. After a few second something like a rock drops from the place where the Demon Lord was. The Demon Lord’s army realize that the Demon Lord is not there anymore. Then they retreat to their place as fast as they can.
	</p><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Did we win? Did we beat the Demon Lord?!” ask one of the soldier. “I think we did.” answer sir Robin with tears. “WE DID IT!!!” shout everyone.”We did it Avelin!” shout Rondal. “Avelin?, Avelin?!, AVELIN!?! EVERYONE, GO LOOK FOR AVELIN!”
	</p><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hours of looking, they couldn’t find a single trace of Avelin. “It’s impossible for her to run to the forest with her wound. Even if she did, i don’t think she has reason to do that. The only thing i can think about is she sacrificed herself to seal the Demon King” said Robin. “Why didn’t she said so :’(” said Randal. “If she said that, we probably won’t gave our power.” said Colart. “That’s right” said Robin. “Not only we lose her, we even lost the sealed Demon King. Now her sacrifice has no meaning” said Randal. After that, they build a statue of Avelin in the middle of the Kingdom to appreciate her sacrifice
